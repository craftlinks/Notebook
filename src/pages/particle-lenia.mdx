# Particle Lenia.

[Lenia](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05433) is a family of cellular automata that produces lifelike behaviors and patterns, first described in the seminal paper by Bert Wang-Chak Chan. 
This project is heavily inspired by the original [Particle Lenia](https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/particle-lenia/) 
research by Alexander Mordvintsev et al., which implemented a particle-based version of Lenia in Python and [JAX](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/). 
Recognizing the importance of scale (number of particles) for simulation dynamics and iteration times for rapid pattern exploration, 
I ported the simulation to the GPU and made it 3D. I also added several update kernels in addition to the original Gaussian one and programmed in 
support for multi-species particle simulations which opens up a whole new breed of Mathematical Lifeforms, some that behave very remensicent to critters found in [Particle Life](https://youtu.be/p4YirERTVF0?si=E2bExaHTX8kbKKtp).

This port was achieved using compute shaders within [Three.js](https://threejs.org/examples/) and the (still unofficial) [Three.js Shading Language (TSL)](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language).
You can explore the Particle Lenia universe yourself at the bottom of this post
on the condition that your browser supports [WebGPU](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API) 
and you have a graphics card with enough muscle top crunch the numbers.
The source code for the Particle Lenia implementation can be found here [TODO], go wild.

## A too short intro to Energy Fields and Particles in Particle Lenia.
 
Particle Lenia defines a **Motion law** in which particles move against the local gradient $\nabla E$ of the _energy field_ $E = R - G$, 
where $R$ is called the **Repulsion Field** and $G$ the **Growth Field**. 
Particles seek the direction of local lowest $E$ by minimizing repulsion energy $R$ and maximizing for $G$. Yes, it is that simple. 
The emergent behaviors and patterns are a consequence of the local particle interactions, and in smaller part by the selection of the kernels (MexicanHat is my favorite).  

If you're interested in the math, I encourage you to read the exposition in the original [Particle Lenia paper](https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/particle-lenia/). 
It only requires that you understand what a 'gradient' is (ask an LLM) and how to apply the chain-rule for finding the differential equations.
