# Particle Lenia

Particle Lenia is a fascinating exploration of emergent behaviors in particle systems, implementing Lenia algorithms on the GPU for real-time visualization and interaction.

## Introduction

Lenia is a family of cellular automata that produces lifelike behaviors and patterns. This project extends the traditional grid-based Lenia into a particle system, creating fluid, organic movements that resemble living organisms.

## Features

- GPU-accelerated particle simulation
- Real-time parameter tuning
- Multiple species interactions
- Emergent behaviors and pattern formation

## Getting Started

This page will guide you through understanding and implementing Particle Lenia systems.

### Basic Concepts

Lenia operates on continuous space and time, using smooth kernels and growth functions to create organic behaviors.

## Examples

Coming soon: Interactive examples and parameter exploration tools.
